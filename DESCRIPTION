Description: 
	The MsQuality provides functionality to calculate quality metrics 
	for mass spectrometry-derived, spectral data at the per-sample level. 
	MsQuality relies on the mzQC framework of quality metrics defined by the 
	Human Proteom Organization-Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI). 
	These metrics quantify the quality of spectral raw files using a controlled 
	vocabulary. The package is especially addressed towards users that acquire 
	mass spectrometry data on a large scale (e.g. data sets from clinical 
	settings consisting of several thousands of samples).
	The MsQuality package allows to calculate low-level quality metrics that 
	require minimum information on mass spectrometry data: retention time, 
	m/z values, and associated intensities. MsQuality relies on the 
	Spectra package, or alternatively the MsExperiment package, and its infrastructure 
	to store spectral data.
